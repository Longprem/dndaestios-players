**Tara, Aethra 5th, 1489 (Hope 225) -**  
I've been sieged by nightmares lately, for a few days. Strange ones. Multiple red eyes, darkness around me. Calling to me. Calling for my aid. I cannot wake up from these episodes; it's like I'm not in control anymore.  
  
I've been to Haventithe this morning, talked with Ordenant Liborius Cragsoar about these visions. He mentioned that nightmares are common omens but recurring ones are dangerous, ill-intended. Could be a curse, could be someone targeted me specifically. Bullshit; I'm loved around here, I'm a model citizen, well above average, making my life. Could be the poors around the cities. I may start a tavern or something down here; money and respect. Yeah.  
  
But I can't shake the feeling that I'm followed around consistently. I can't shake that feeling. I mean, there's "being followed" but being sought apart from the Gods. I hope from Hirion's head that it's not bad luck.  
  
I bought some herbal tea this morning from the market, straight from Lanua'ri. I hope it will help me sleep correctly.  
  
  
**Fira, Solemthra 14th, 1489 (Hope 225) -**  
I can't sleep. I cannot sleep. I can't. It's been 5 days where I can't sleep at all. I've tried everything; teas, drugs, trying to exhaust myself.  
Every time I reach for the sleep, I see those red eyes. They are onto me.  
Leave me alone.  
Leave me alone.  
Please leave me alone.  
I'm scared. I can't focus. I can't do shit. I'm exhausted; my dear Julian is trying to help me as well. He's desperate, I'm desperate. I can't be mad against him; he's doing his best.  
  
But why me? Why me?  
  
  
**Tara, Esmithra 16th, 1489 (Hope 225) -**  
I was able to sleep, finally. Only a couple of hours though.  
My nightmares changed. There was a woman. Old, elf with a dark skin, long white hair. Drow definitely. White eyes, blind. She called my name. Not my husband name, my maiden name: "Come Muldova. I need you. We need you." and then nothing. Just good sleep. Finally.  
  
I'm not sure who she is. Is she the one doing these nightmares? Making me stop sleep? I just can't deal with that.  
  
With the elections going in Hope's Republic, I need to be ready to make an appearance for them. Making myself viable as a trade partner. Good opportunities, will be able to expand there or at least be a conduit for their commerce. I still need to talk with Hiruath for their cargo coming from Hope. I just need to buy in a crew tomorrow in Paleharbor so I can show them that I can be of service. I can't wait to sell it in Brathia, making a metric ton of gold on these exotics goods. I just hope it's not contraband, been there before.  
  
  
**Dera, Esmithra 18th 1489 (Hope 225) -**  
She spoke her name! Zesle. The drow reached out to me again.  
I'm paraphrasing here:  
"Please, help us. My name is Zesle. We need you. I can only contact you here, so I'll be brief. We are stuck under the city, imprisoned. We've been trying to reach people that can help us."  
  
It got cut off by a breathing of some kind. Rough, deep. Some kind of growling. I do hope they are okay. I might go the guilds and see what I can gather; people? Folks that can help? I don't know. I hope I won't be judged to be crazy of some kind.  
  
  
**Tara, Esmithra 21th 1489 (Hope 225) -**  
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.  
I killed him, but I can't remember. My dear Julian.  
  
  
**Yura, Esmithra 22th 1489 (Hope 225) -**  
I've hidden his corpse away. I'm so sorry Julian, but I can't. I need to make this stop.  
  
  
**Lora, Solemthra 1th 1489 (Hope 225) -**  
I'm getting crazy. Stuff disappears and moves around the house. My house is well protected against intruders so why this happens? My Julian frames are telling me that nobody went around except me.  
  
I got it; I've been sleepwalking. Julian in the park told me. It was me during the night.  
  
There are holes in the basement. "I" have been digging. I have to make it stop.  
  
**  
Yura, Solemthra 18th 1489 (Hope 225) -**  
My body is sore. I think I'm digging all night when I'm sleeping.  
There is a mirror that appeared in the basement. I don't know where it came from. There is also an handheld mirror as well.  
  
I'm researching to make it stop. I got some magical components, I'll dabble in magic.  
  
  
**Tara, Tomithra 3th 1489 (Hope 225) -**  
Zesle appeared this time. In the mirrors. She talked to me. I'm scared; she says I can't escape it. I'm under her control. She killed my dear Julian.  
She wants to talk with me. We have a rendez-vous in the graveyard, in the Plains, tonight. I have to go alone. I have to do what she wants if I want to make it to stop. I'm not done fighting, I'll search something, whatever it takes. I fucking hate her. Fuck my life.  
  
I've met her, mostly. It was an illusion, an image of her. There were some other people there as well. Two other drows, other people with their eyes closed. They were asleep, but moving! That's what she's doing, she controls you from your sleep!  
  
She wanted me to do something. I heard that her plan failed or something, I had to pose and try to snag a cargo. They gave me a piece of paper with this symbol on it.  

![[Pasted image 20220325220742.png]]
// Blae'bir symbol  
  
That's the Blae'bir symbol. I'm so in fucking deep trouble, I don't want to do anything with them. It will run my reputation! Fuck.  
I have to do it. She will release me, she says, if I bring it back to Brathia. She said that I wasn't alone on this. Other will try to get it as well, but only the one that brings it back will be free.  
  
I'm done. I'm just done. I have to do it. I don't want to be a pawn in their play. The drows are just a fucking pile of problems, just waiting to happen.  
  
I said I was doing it. They gave me a chest to pay some expenses I need to do. If they had multiple people doing that... they are rich, or something like that.  
  
  
**Dera, Tomithra 5th 1489 (Hope 225) -**  
My route is planned, going to catch that cargo at Eboncross. Managed to catch a ride with the Skyclave guild, will be faster. I'm thinking about to get some adventurers to catch it up. Easy for me, easy for them.  
  
I noticed as well that the gold given to me is not the same in Brathia... I don't recognize it. It's not any currency we are using either in the Empire, the Republic nor the Dynasty. By the state of their coins, it seems really old.  
  
I'll check that once I come back home. I'm just happy I'm out of the city. It's a good change of pace.
